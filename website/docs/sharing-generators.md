title: Sharing Generators
---

To share your generator with others, you can push your the generator directory to GitHub or to any Git provider that is supported by SAO. It's recommended to create a repository following the `sao-*` naming convention.

However, it's recommeneded to publish your generator on npm too.

📝 **package.json**:

```json
{
  "name": "sao-foo",
  "files": ["saofile.js", "template"],
  "keywords": ["sao-generator", "sao", "scaffolding"]
}
```
